# Library book code system
This system will be specific to the management of **book codes** in a university library. The main function of this system is to efficiently generate unique book codes for each book in the library based on genre, author, title and supplier.

Once all books in the library have their unique codes, the system will work to ensure that as new books are added to the library system, all codes will remain unique no matter what. Books can be supplied to the library by a company or by a library member.

If the supplier of a book is a library member, the member's initials will be included in the book's code. If the supplier of the book is a company, the first letter of the company's name will be included in the book's code.

This system will make the jobs of librarians much simpler as they would easily be able to locate any books that customers may request, because every code is unique and based on its genre, author, title and supplier.

## Use Case:

A supplier (company or library member) supplies the library with a new book. The librarian opens the application to add the book to the system by inserting all of the book's details. Once all details have been added, the system generates a unique code for that book. The code is printed onto a sticker. The sticker is stuck onto the book. The book gets added onto the shelves.
